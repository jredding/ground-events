Today's haiku inspiration:
{events_summary}

---

Create a haiku (5-7-5 syllable structure) that captures the essence of today's food truck scene in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. Your haiku should:

1. Reflect the current season and time of year based on today's date
2. Feature the specific food truck ({truck_name}) and brewery ({brewery_name}) mentioned above
3. Evoke the atmosphere of gathering at local breweries and food spots
4. Balance concrete sensory details with seasonal imagery

The haiku should feel authentic to the Pacific Northwest autumn/winter/spring/summer experience and celebrate the diversity of street food culture. Avoid being overly literal - aim for evocative, poetic language that honors the traditional haiku form.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- The haiku MUST be exactly 3 lines of text
- Each line must contain actual words, not just emojis
- The haiku MUST start with an emoji at the BEGINNING of the first line AND end with an emoji at the END of the third line (inline with the text)
- Do NOT put emojis on their own separate lines
- Good examples:

🍂 Autumn mist rolls in—
Plaza Garcia's warmth glows
at Obec's wood door 🍺

☀️ Summer sun beams bright
Where Ya At Matt hangs at Stoup,
Hops drank with good eats 🍺

Return only the haiku with inline emoji, nothing else.
